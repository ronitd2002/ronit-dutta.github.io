					<!--<p>I am a visiting researcher at the <a href="https://paganolab.rice.edu/">Trapped Ion Quantum Simulation Lab</a> at Rice University and a physics graduate from IIT Kharagpur. As a student, I have always been passionate about systems that are beautifully complex, presenting a challenge to first model them down to fundamentals, that are often hidden, then taking different routes upwards to study or even control the different phenomena that occur. With this spirit in the form of an algorithm at hand, I have been actively exploring the different interfaces of <b>condensed matter physics, optics</b> <b>and quantum devices</b>.</p>
					
					<p>As a basic sciences student in an institute with many engineering departments, I got the opportunity to learn rigorous analytical and experimental methods to study nature. At the same time, I was exposed to various technological avenues like robotics, electronics and machine learning which I have observed sharing a bidirectional transfer of techniques with physics research. Not only have I seen this in practically every one of my projects, but this exposure has also assisted me in determining the areas of physics that I find particularly interesting.</p>
					
					<p>Apart from all these so called nerdy stuff, I often spend some time playing classical guitar or editing travel videos.</p>-->
